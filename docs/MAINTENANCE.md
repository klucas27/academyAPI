# Maintenance Guidelines for Academy API

This document provides guidelines for maintaining the Academy API project. It includes instructions on updating dependencies, managing the database, and troubleshooting common issues.

## Updating Dependencies

1. **Check for Updates**:
   Use the following command to check for outdated packages:
   ```
   npm outdated
   ```

2. **Update Packages**:
   To update all packages to their latest versions, run:
   ```
   npm update
   ```

3. **Update Specific Package**:
   If you want to update a specific package, use:
   ```
   npm install <package-name>@latest
   ```

4. **Review Changes**:
   After updating, review the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to ensure that the updates are reflected.

5. **Test the Application**:
   After updating dependencies, run the application and perform tests to ensure everything works as expected.


## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Environment Variables**:
   Ensure that all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file. Missing variables can cause the application to fail.

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   If you encounter issues connecting to the database, check the following:
   - Ensure the database server is running.
   - Verify the credentials in the `.env` file.
   - Check network connectivity if the database is hosted remotely.

3. **JWT Token Issues**:
   If users are experiencing issues with authentication, ensure that the JWT secret in the `.env` file is correct and that tokens are being generated and validated properly.

4. **API Errors**:
   Monitor the logs for any errors returned by the API. Implement proper error handling in your routes to provide meaningful messages to users.

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   Regularly monitor the performance of the application and database. Use tools like New Relic or Google Cloud Monitoring to identify bottlenecks.

By following these maintenance guidelines, you can ensure the smooth operation and longevity of the Academy API project.
